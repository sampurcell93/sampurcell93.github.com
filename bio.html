				<h2>Samuel Miles Purcell: A biography</h2>

				<p>My life began not with a whimper, but with a bang. Exploding forth from the womb like a creature from a Ridley Scott movie, placenta covered the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. The hapless young doctor tried to grab me as I slipped from the loins of my progenitor, but I was too slippery. I remember the scents and sounds vividly. Nurses scrambled to grab me as I sped along the slick floor, eyes fixed on the door. Their shouts were a fuzzy pounding in my ears as freedom approached. The door was inches away.</p>
				<p>All of a sudden, a sharp yank at my navel. The cord had neven been cut. It pulled me back to their grasp like a dog bound by an electric collar. "Hey little fella, where were you going?" The doctor smiles reassuringly. I begin to cry.</p>
